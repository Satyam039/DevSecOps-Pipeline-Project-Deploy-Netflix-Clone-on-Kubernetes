# DevSecOps-Pipeline-Project-Deploy-Netflix-Clone-on-Kubernetes

ðŸ”¹ Key Features & Objectives
âœ… CI/CD Pipeline â€“ Automates the build, test, and deployment process using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or ArgoCD.
âœ… Security (DevSecOps) â€“ Implements security scans, vulnerability assessments, and compliance checks at each stage.
âœ… Containerization with Docker â€“ Packages the Netflix Clone as a Docker container for scalable deployment.
âœ… Kubernetes Deployment â€“ Uses K8s manifests (YAML files) for managing pods, services, and deployments.
âœ… Monitoring & Logging â€“ Integrates Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack for performance tracking and log management.
âœ… Infrastructure as Code (IaC) â€“ Uses Terraform or Helm Charts to automate cloud resource provisioning.
âœ… Cloud Deployment â€“ Deploys to AWS (EKS), GCP (GKE), or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
âœ… Load Balancing & Autoscaling â€“ Uses Ingress Controllers and Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) for traffic management.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

ðŸ”¹ Workflow
Code & Version Control: Developers push code to GitHub/GitLab.

CI/CD Pipeline: Automated builds, security scans, and tests.

Containerization: Code is built into Docker images and pushed to a registry.

Security Scanning: Tools like Trivy scan images for vulnerabilities.

Kubernetes Deployment: Helm charts or YAML files deploy the app.

Monitoring & Scaling: Logs, metrics, and alerts are monitored using Prometheus & Grafana.

Security Compliance: Ensures best security practices are followed.
